Moonstreet is the name of the street where I live, together with my lovely girlfriend and all sorts of laptops and computers.

These are my notes about Automation, Devops and SRE. I use the following techniques:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator
- [Github](https://github.com), for version control
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), for deployment

## About Automation

I like to automate all the things. Cloud provisioning, configurations, application deployment, container deployment and orchestration.. In this blog I will write things down not only because I have a tendency to forget stuff but also because I like to share what I know. And learn as I go.
