This is a blog about Automation and CyberSecurity. It is run by us, Miranda and Jacqueline. For this blog we make use of the following techniques:

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator
- [Github](https://github.com), for version control
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), for deployment

## About Automation

I like to automate all the things. Cloud provisioning, configurations, application deployment, container deployment and orchestration.. In this blog I will write things down not only because I have a tendency to forget stuff but also because I like to share what I know. And learn as I go.
