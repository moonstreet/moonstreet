&lt;p>Here is a post about how to create virtual machines with Vagrant and the libvirt plugin.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-use-libvirt-as-a-vagrant-provider">Why use libvirt as a vagrant provider&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Because when on a modern Linux distro running Gnome, chances are it's already there!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use Vagrant extensively to run quick, short lived virtual machines to test and try out things. I always used and use Virtualbox as a virtual machine provider for Vagrant.
Maybe I am late to the party but I recently discovered &lt;a href="https://help.gnome.org/users/gnome-boxes/stable/supported-protocols.html.en">Gnome Boxes&lt;/a> and I was wondering about the underlying architecture. Then I went on vacation and finally took the time to investigate.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
