      <description>This is a post about my workflow when editing files in the terminal.
When editing files quickly I usually resort to vim. It requires a lot of muscle memory but hey, one needs to train their reptile brain, right.
Tmux config So I use tmux and vim so you need those two installed. My tmux config is really simple. I changed the leader key to ctrl+q for easy reach on my keyboard.</description>

      <title>A minimal Arch Linux installation with Gnome. My notes.</title>

      <description>Arch Linux is extremely well documented so I highly recommend to read the Arch installation guide. This guide installs the Gnome desktop environment, but one can easily swap Gnome for i3 or another desktop environment, or leave it all together. This is the procedure I used for installing Arch on a Thinkpad t460s, t490s and a Dell Precision 5550.
Partitioning Checkout the current partition scheme and the name of the harddrive(s)</description>

      <title>Install the Nginx ingress controller on K3s - or Kind - and deploy a web app</title>

      <description>Here is how to quickly install Kubernetes with ingress on your laptop. I use this to test and create operators with the Operator Framework. Still learning though.
I was first using K3s but then I discovered Kind which seems to be even faster, deployment wise. Also it leaves a smaller footprint because it runs in a Docker container. (Didn&#39;t manage to run it with podman yet). So I quickly added a paragraph about Kind if you scroll down this post.</description>

      <title>K3s on a Centos vm</title>

      <description>This post is about installing lightweight Kubernetes (K3s) on our new vm.
K3s The previous post was all about being able to install Kubernetes quickly. For that I will use k3s from Rancher because it is fast. Let&#39;s go!
Prepare We do this for testing so we can safely disable the firewall and SELinux on our CentOS vm. This is because SELinux is still experimental in K3s. We also need to enable ssh password authentication so we can issue scp commands from our host machine.</description>

      <title>Vagrant with the libvirt plugin</title>

      <description>Here is a post about how to create virtual machines with Vagrant and the libvirt plugin.
Why use libvirt as a vagrant provider Because when on a modern Linux distro running Gnome, chances are it&#39;s already there!
I use Vagrant extensively to run quick, short lived virtual machines to test and try out things. I always used and use Virtualbox as a virtual machine provider for Vagrant. Maybe I am late to the party but I recently discovered Gnome Boxes and I was wondering about the underlying architecture.</description>
