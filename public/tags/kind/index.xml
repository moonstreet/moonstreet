      <description>Here is how to quickly install Kubernetes with ingress on your laptop. I use this to test and create operators with the Operator Framework. Still learning though.
I was first using K3s but then I discovered Kind which seems to be even faster, deployment wise. Also it leaves a smaller footprint because it runs in a Docker container. (Didn&#39;t manage to run it with podman yet). So I quickly added a paragraph about Kind if you scroll down this post.</description>
