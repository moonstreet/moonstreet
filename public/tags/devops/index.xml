      <description>Currently I am working for a SaaS project that has some Microservices which are hosted on Kubernetes. And as a devops engineer I am not only responsible for the continuously delivery part but also for things like monitoring.
It seems like Prometheus is the de-facto monitoring solution for Kubernetes nowadays. Prometheus is very popular according to the CNCF project and is also mentioned in the Kubernetes docs.
