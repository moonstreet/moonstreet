      <description>Prometheus delivers real-time monitoring, alerting and time-series database capabilities including powerful queries and visualizations. Written in Go, Prometheus is one of the fastest-growing projects on GitHub according to the CNCF project and is also mentioned in the Kubernetes docs.
